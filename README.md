# instagram_clone_application

I made this Instagram Clone with Flutter in 4 Days and learned to use so many widgets and so many new physics in flutter,
this project was so hard and It had many challenges for me.
Attention!!!: the views all are static and all data is in the app and its just local ui and data.
I share the code to you for watch and give it a star .
and you can see the app screen record below the description here :
